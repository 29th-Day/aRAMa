# Contributing to aRAMa

Thank you for your interest in contributing to aRAMa! Please take a moment to review the following guidelines to ensure a smooth contribution process and help reduce the maintenance workload.

## Code Formatting

Before committing, please use the provided `.editorconfig` to ensure your code follows a consistent style. While there may be "more optimal" formatting approaches, a consistent style is far better than an inconsistent one — regardless of how good it may be.

## Documentation

If you modify any documented code, please take the extra minute to update the documentation as well. Few things are worse than outdated documentation...well, maybe no documentation at all. So, when you add new features, make sure to include documentation where possible.

## Testing

Since the software is cross-compiled for a different architecture (unless you happen to be a wizard developing directly on a Wii U), automated testing is impractical. Instead, please test your changes by running aRAMa on a console and checking for unexpected issues. If you don’t have the means to test it yourself or encounter difficulties, reach out to the community — there may be others willing to help with testing.

## Further questions & help

If you have any further questions, suggestions, or inquiries, feel free to join the [aRAMa Discord Server](https://discord.com/invite/VPHr56hnbQ) or explore the other servers linked in the repository's README.
