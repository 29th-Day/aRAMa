# What is this?
This is an unofficial TCPGecko port/rewrite for Aroma. 

**At the time of writing this, this is a work in progress and does not work yet**. 

# How do I use this?
This is a plugin for Aroma. Check to make sure it is enabled in the plugin menu. You will have an option in the plugin menu to use "SD codes", which are codes that are locally stored on the SD card instead of sent from a client.

# Compiling

As stated previously, this project is not done yet. However, I will list the libraries I am using/will use in it, for future reference in case I forget to add this later.

To compile this, you will (probably) need:
* `devkitpro`:
  * `libogc`
  * `wut`
* `libfunctionpatcher`
* `libkernel`
