# What is this?
This is an unofficial TCPGecko port/rewrite for Aroma. 

**At the time of writing this, this is a work in progress and does not work yet**. 

By the looks of it, most of the original code will be gutted and/or rewritten to use WUT and several WUMS libraries that fulfill the same functionality. It's mostly a fork for the purpose of not being yelled at about "stolen code"

# How do I use this?
This is a plugin for Aroma. Check to make sure it is enabled in the plugin menu. You will have an option in the plugin menu to use "SD codes", which are codes that are locally stored on the SD card instead of sent from a client.
